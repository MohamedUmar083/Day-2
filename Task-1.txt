The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It serves as an interface to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), 
which is a hierarchical representation of the HTML structure. Through the Document object, 
developers can access and manipulate elements within the DOM, such as modifying content, styling, or adding event listeners.

3. Window Object: The Browser's Global Context

The Window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the DOM document. 
It serves as the global context for JavaScript code running within the browser environment. 
Additionally, the Window object provides access to various browser-related functionalities and properties, such as controlling navigation, managing timers, and handling the browser's history.
